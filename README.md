# Clocks

Clocks is a very basic project made to experiment clean architecture. It is based on the [Berlin Clock](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mengenlehreuhr>).

## Installation

To test my project, you only need to clone it. Then you have to choose which configuration you want to run.

### Console

The first configuration works with console. You need to run the  ``fr.lukam.clock.application.main.console.ConsoleMain`` class which is in the ``Application`` module. Then the program will ask you to enter hours, minutes and seconds. Finally a representation of the Berlin Clock matching with your entries will be displayed in the console.

### JavaFx

The second configuration works with JavaFx 13. You need to run the  ``fr.lukam.clock.application.main.javafx.JavaFxMain`` class which is in the ``Application`` module. Then the program will run and display the Berlin Clock each second.
